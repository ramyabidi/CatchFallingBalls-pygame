# Catch Falling Balls Game

Catch Falling Balls is a simple arcade game developed using the Pygame library in Python. The objective of the game is to move the basket left and right to catch falling balls, earning points for each successful catch. The game has two versions with slightly different gameplay and features.

## üéÆ Game Versions

### Version 1 (game1.py)

- In Version 1 of the game, falling balls have varying speeds (between 1 and 5).
- The game runs for a total of 60 seconds, and the player's score is recorded.
- At the end of the game, the player's score is displayed along with the top five high scores.
- If the player achieves a new high score, it is highlighted in the end-game message box.

### Version 2 (game2.py)

- Version 2 of the game features falling balls with reduced or fixed speeds (can be adjusted).
- Instead of a fixed time limit, the game continues until the player misses three balls.
- The end-game message box appears when the player misses three balls, showing the final score and top five high scores.
- After the game is over, the player can choose to restart the game or quit.
